      "solution_explanation": "Tableau's { FIXED [PolicyID] : COUNT([ClaimID]) } is a FIXED LOD that computes the count of ClaimID for each PolicyID regardless of other view filters. In DAX this is implemented as a measure that captures the current PolicyID with SELECTEDVALUE and then counts rows from ALL('customers+') filtered to that PolicyID where ClaimID is not blank. COUNTROWS + NOT(ISBLANK()) is used because ClaimID is a string in the source.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The calculation uses a FIXED LOD expression ({ FIXED ... }) which is an aggregate/context-based operation, so it should be created as a measure."
