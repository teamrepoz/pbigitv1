      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau IF/ELSEIF/ELSE logic to nested DAX IF statements. All field references were transformed to the table-qualified format 'Sheet1 (radial_bar_chart_data)'[Column]. Mathematical and trig functions (SIN, multiplication, division) were kept with equivalent DAX functions. Intermediate values were captured in VARs for readability.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The calculation relies on table calculations (INDEX, WINDOW_MAX) and aggregated/windowed fields, which require evaluation in a filter/aggregation context — therefore it must be created as a measure."
