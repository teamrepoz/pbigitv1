      "solution_explanation": "Tableau's INDEX() is a table calculation. In DAX there is no direct INDEX() function; a common pattern is to emulate row indexing with RANKX over the table's current selection. This measure computes a row index (using RANKX over ALLSELECTED for the current partition) then applies the original arithmetic (index - 1) * 2.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The calculation uses the table calculation INDEX(), so it should be created as a measure."
