      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau table calculation to a measure. INDEX() is emulated with RANKX over ALLSELECTED using the underlying field 'rossmann_sales_prediction_aggregated'[Total Sales] (Radial Field maps to [Total Sales]). WINDOW_COUNT(COUNT([Radial Field])) is represented by COUNTROWS(ALLSELECTED('rossmann_sales_prediction_aggregated')). The expression guards against division by zero and multiplies by 2 * PI() as in the original."
