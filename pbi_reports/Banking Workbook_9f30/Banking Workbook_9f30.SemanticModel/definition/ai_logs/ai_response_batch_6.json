      "solution_explanation": "Translated the aggregate expression by replacing the Tableau calculated fields with CALCULATE + SUM on the base Amount column filtered by TransactionType. SUM([Deposit amount]) -> CALCULATE(SUM('accounts+'[Amount]), 'accounts+'[TransactionType] = \"Deposit\"); SUM([Withdrawal Amount]) -> CALCULATE(SUM('accounts+'[Amount]), 'accounts+'[TransactionType] = \"Withdrawal\"). All column references use 'table'[column] format.",
