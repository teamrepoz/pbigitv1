      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau parameter 'Select Year' which is defined as the literal 1896 into a DAX measure returning the same constant. In Power BI, parameters/parameter-based calculations are represented as measures and referenced using SELECTEDVALUE when used in other expressions.",
