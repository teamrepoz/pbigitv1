      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau aggregation of two calculated fields into DAX by summing 'Amount' with filters on 'TransactionType'. Used CALCULATE(SUM(...), filter) for each side and subtracted Withdrawal from Deposit. Created as a measure because the original uses aggregations (SUM)."
