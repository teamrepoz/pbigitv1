      "solution_explanation": "Tableau RANK(SUM([Volume])) is translated to DAX using RANKX over the full table. The SUM aggregation is expressed as CALCULATE(SUM('stock_data+'[Volume])) and the ranking is computed across ALL('stock_data+') to mirror Tableau's table calculation ranking context. This is implemented as a measure because the calculation relies on aggregation/table calculation (SUM and RANK)."
