      "solution_explanation": "Tableau's WINDOW_MAX(MAX([Order])) is a table calculation that computes the maximum of the aggregated MAX([Order]) over the current window/partition. In DAX, this is represented by calculating the overall MAX of the Order column within the current selection context using CALCULATE with ALLSELECTED to emulate the windowing behavior.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The Tableau expression uses a table calculation (WINDOW_MAX) and an aggregation (MAX), which require context-aware evaluation in DAX, so it must be implemented as a measure."
