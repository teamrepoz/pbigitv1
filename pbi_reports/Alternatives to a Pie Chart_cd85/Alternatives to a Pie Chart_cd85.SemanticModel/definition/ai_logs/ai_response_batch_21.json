      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau SUM(IF [StoreType] = \"d\" THEN [Sales] END)/SUM([Sales]) to DAX by calculating the sales for StoreType = \"d\" using CALCULATE + SUM and dividing by total SUM of Sales. DIVIDE is used to safely handle division by zero. All column references use the 'table'[column] format.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The calculation uses aggregation (SUM), so it should be created as a measure."
