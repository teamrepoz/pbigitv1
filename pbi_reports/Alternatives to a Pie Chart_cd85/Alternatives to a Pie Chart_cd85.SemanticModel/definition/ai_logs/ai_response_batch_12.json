      "solution_explanation": "Translated Tableau table calculations to DAX: INDEX() approximated with RANKX over the current partition using 'rossmann_sales_prediction_aggregated'[Total Sales] as the ordering expression; WINDOW_COUNT(COUNT([Radial Field])) mapped to COUNTROWS(ALLSELECTED('rossmann_sales_prediction_aggregated')) to represent the number of rows in the current window/partition. Arithmetic preserved and PI() used for the 2*PI multiplier.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The Tableau formula uses table calculations (INDEX, WINDOW_COUNT) which are context/aggregation-based, so it must be created as a measure."
