      "solution_explanation": "INDEX() is a Tableau table calculation (row position within the partition). In DAX there is no direct INDEX() equivalent; the common approach is to use RANKX over the desired partition/order. This measure uses RANKX(ALLSELECTED(...), 1, , ASC, DENSE) as a placeholder to generate a positional rank and then applies the arithmetic (Index - 1) * 2. To make this behave exactly like the original Tableau INDEX(), replace the expression argument (currently 1) with the appropriate ordering expression or column that defines row order within the partition.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The Tableau expression uses the INDEX() table calculation which depends on the visual/table context, so it must be implemented as a measure in Power BI."
