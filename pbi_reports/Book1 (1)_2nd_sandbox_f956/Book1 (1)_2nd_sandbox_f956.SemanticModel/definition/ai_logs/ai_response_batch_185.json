      "solution_explanation": "The Tableau expression is a literal string \"Swap Spread\". In DAX a string literal also uses double quotes, so the calculated column simply returns \"Swap Spread\" for each row. There are no aggregations or parameters, so this is a row-level calculation and should be a calculated column."
