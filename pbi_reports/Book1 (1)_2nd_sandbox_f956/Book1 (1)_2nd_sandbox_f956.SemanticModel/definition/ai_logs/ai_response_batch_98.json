      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau expression [Delta Down T CAD 2Y]*[Date Sign] to DAX by referencing the fields with the table[column] format. Kept the multiplication as a simple inline DAX expression and treated it as a measure because one of the referenced calculated fields (Date Sign) depends on Tableau parameters.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The expression references a calculated field ('Date Sign') that depends on Tableau parameters (e.g. [Parameters].[Use Custom Date]); per the rules, any parameter-based calculation must be created as a measure."
