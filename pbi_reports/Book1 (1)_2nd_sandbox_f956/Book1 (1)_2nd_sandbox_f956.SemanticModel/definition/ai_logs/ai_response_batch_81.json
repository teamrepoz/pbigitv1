      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau expression by removing comments and translating the row-level multiplication to DAX. Both referenced calculated fields were converted to fully qualified references using the table name: 'Risk_GFIRates_Reports_Excel_Rolling (local copy)'[Delta Down All CCY 30Y CAD] and 'Risk_GFIRates_Reports_Excel_Rolling (local copy)'[Date Sign].",
      "type_changed_reason": "The referenced calculated field 'Date Sign' uses Tableau parameters. Per the rules, any calculation that references parameters must be created as a measure."
