      "solution_explanation": "Direct multiplication of the two referenced calculated fields translated to DAX. All field references use the 'TableName'[Column] format as required. No additional aggregation or VARs were necessary for this simple expression.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The expression depends on the calculated field 'Date Sign', which references Tableau [Parameters]. Per the rules, any calculation that references parameters must be implemented as a measure."
