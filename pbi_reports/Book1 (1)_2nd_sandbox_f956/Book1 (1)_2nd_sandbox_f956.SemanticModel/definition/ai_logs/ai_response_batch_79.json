      "solution_explanation": "Mapped each column reference to the table-qualified format and translated the row-level multiplication into a measure by aggregating the per-row product with SUMX so the result is a scalar measure. Date Sign remains referenced as a column within the SUMX iterator.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The referenced calculated field 'Date Sign' relies on Tableau [Parameters], and per rules any formula that references parameters must be converted to a measure. Additionally, measures must return a scalar, so the row-level product is aggregated using SUMX."
