      "solution_explanation": "Tableau's WINDOW_MAX(MAX([Value])) is a table calculation that returns the maximum of the aggregated Value across the window. In DAX, this is represented by using MAXX over ALLSELECTED to emulate the table-calculation window scope: MAXX(ALLSELECTED('Data (Complaint Line)'), 'Data (Complaint Line)'[Value]). The result is implemented as a measure because it relies on table-calculation/aggregation semantics."
