Implemented as DIVIDE([Number of Complaints], CALCULATE([Number of Complaints], ALL('complaints'))) to compute percent of total. Used CALCULATE with ALL('complaints') to replicate TOTAL across the full partition and DIVIDE to guard against division by zero. Created as a measure because it relies on aggregation/table calculation."
