      "solution_explanation": "Removed Tableau comment and converted the IF expression to DAX IF. The referenced field [MTD Value - YoY] was fully qualified to 'Orders (Sample - Superstore)'[MTD Value - YoY]. String literals use double quotes in DAX. The logic returns a downward arrow when the YoY value is negative, otherwise an empty string.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The calculation references an aggregated/calculated field [MTD Value - YoY] (which depends on aggregates/LOD and a parameter), so it must be implemented as a measure."
