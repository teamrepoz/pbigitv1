      "solution_explanation": "In Tableau [Max Date] is defined as an aggregated LOD ({MAX([Order Date])}). The DAX measure first computes the overall max order date using CALCULATE + ALL to emulate the LOD, stores it in a VAR, and then returns the date one year earlier using DATE(YEAR-1, MONTH, DAY).",
      "type_changed_reason": "The calculation depends on an aggregated value (Max Date defined as {MAX([Order Date])}), therefore it must be created as a measure."
