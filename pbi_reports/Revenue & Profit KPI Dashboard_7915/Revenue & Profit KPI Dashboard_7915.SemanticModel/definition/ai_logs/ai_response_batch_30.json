      "solution_explanation": "Translated the Tableau IF expression to DAX IF. The referenced calculated field [YTD Value - YoY] is an aggregate-based calculation, so the reference is kept in the 'Orders (Sample - Superstore)'[YTD Value - YoY] format and the result returns the arrow character when the value equals zero, otherwise an empty string.",
      "type_changed_reason": "This calculation depends on the aggregated calculated field 'YTD Value - YoY' (which uses SUM/aggregation), so it should be implemented as a measure."
