      "solution_explanation": "The Tableau FIXED LOD { FIXED [CustomerID] : SUM([LineTotal]) } computes a customer-level aggregate that ignores other row/context filters. In DAX this is achieved with CALCULATE over SUM of LineTotal while removing all filters except CustomerID using ALLEXCEPT on the same table.",
