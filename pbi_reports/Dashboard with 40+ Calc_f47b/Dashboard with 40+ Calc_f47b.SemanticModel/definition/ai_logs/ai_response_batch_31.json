All column references were transformed to 'TableName'[ColumnName] format: [Revenue Tier] -> 'Orders+ (Sample - Superstore)'[Revenue Tier], [Profitablity Tier] -> 'Orders+ (Sample - Superstore)'[Profitablity Tier]. This is created as a calculated column because it performs row-level logical evaluation between fields without aggregations or parameters."
