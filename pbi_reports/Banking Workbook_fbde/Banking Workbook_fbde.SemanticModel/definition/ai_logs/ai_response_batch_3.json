      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau IF expression to a row-level DAX calculated column. The IF condition checks 'accounts+'[TransactionType] = \"Withdrawal\" and returns 'accounts+'[Amount] when true; otherwise returns BLANK(). All column references were transformed to the 'TableName'[Column] format and no aggregation or parameters are present, so this is a calculated column."
