      "solution_explanation": "Replaced ATTR([Selected Product]) with SELECTEDVALUE('complaints'[Selected Product]) to get the single selected product in the filter context; replaced [Number of Complaints] (COUNTD([Complaint ID])) with DISTINCTCOUNT('complaints'[Complaint ID]). The expression returns the distinct count only when the selected product is not \"NOT SELECTED\", otherwise returns blank.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The calculation references an aggregation (COUNTD → DISTINCTCOUNT), so it must be created as a measure."
