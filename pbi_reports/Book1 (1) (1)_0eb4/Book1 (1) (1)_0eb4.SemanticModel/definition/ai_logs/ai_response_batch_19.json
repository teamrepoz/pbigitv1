      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau IF to a DAX IF, transformed all field references to 'migration_Extract_POC (1) (local copy)'[Column], used && for logical AND, kept string literals in double quotes, and retained INT() and the return values (Initial Cash USD T or 0).",
      "type_changed_reason": "The calculation references calculated fields (e.g., [date series] which depends on [fixed DTM]) that include a LOD ({ FIXED ... }) in their definition, indicating aggregate/context-based logic; therefore it must be implemented as a measure."
