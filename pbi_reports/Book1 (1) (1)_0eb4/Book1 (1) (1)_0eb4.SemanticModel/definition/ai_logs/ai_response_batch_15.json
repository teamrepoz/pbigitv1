The per-context value is ABS(SUM(...)) (as provided by the calculated field mapping). The TOTAL table calculation is implemented using CALCULATE(..., ALL(Table)) to get the table-level total. DIVIDE is used to safely perform the division. All column references were converted to 'Table'[Column] format."
