      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau expression to DAX by expanding the referenced calculated field 'Initial Cash USD T (excl Int/FWD) Abs' into ABS(SUM(...)) and replacing the Tableau TOTAL(...) table calculation with CALCULATE(..., ALL(table)) to compute the grand total over the table. All column references were transformed to the 'TableName'[Column] format.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The Tableau formula uses a table calculation (TOTAL) and aggregates (SUM), which require evaluation over the filter/context — therefore it must be implemented as a measure."
