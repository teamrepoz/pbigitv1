      "solution_explanation": "Reproduced the Tableau expression by computing the row/partition sum as ABS(SUM(...)) and using CALCULATE(..., ALL(table)) as the DAX equivalent of Tableau's TOTAL(...) to get the table-level total; finally used DIVIDE for safe division.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The Tableau expression uses TOTAL (a table calculation) and ABS(SUM(...)), which are aggregate/context-based operations, so this must be created as a measure."
