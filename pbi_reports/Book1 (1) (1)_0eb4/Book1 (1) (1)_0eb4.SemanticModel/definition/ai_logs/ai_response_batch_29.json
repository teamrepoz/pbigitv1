      "solution_explanation": "Replaced the FIXED LOD by grouping the table at the FIXED keys using SUMMARIZE and computing the per-group sum with CALCULATE (applying the same boolean filters). Then summarized across groups with SUMX( ..., ABS(groupSum)). This preserves the semantics of the Tableau {FIXED ... : SUM(...)} wrapped by ABS and an outer SUM.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The Tableau expression uses a FIXED LOD and aggregation (Sum), which requires an aggregate/context-aware calculation in Power BI, so it must be implemented as a measure."
