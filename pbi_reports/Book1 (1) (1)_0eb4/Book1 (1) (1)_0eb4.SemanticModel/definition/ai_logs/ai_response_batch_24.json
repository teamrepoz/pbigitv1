      "solution_explanation": "Tableau's INDEX() is a table calculation that returns the row position in the current partition and depends on the visual sort order. In Power BI / DAX this must be implemented as a measure (commonly using RANKX over ALL or ALLSELECTED with an explicit expression that represents the visual sort). The expression provided is a template using RANKX over ALLSELECTED for the table; you must replace the ranking expression (currently 0) with the actual column/expression that defines the sort/order in your visual so the index behaves as expected.",
      "type_changed_reason": "INDEX() is a table calculation (a window function) and therefore requires a measure in Power BI rather than a row-level calculated column."
