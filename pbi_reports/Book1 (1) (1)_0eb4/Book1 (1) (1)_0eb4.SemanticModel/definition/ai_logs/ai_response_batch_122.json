      "solution_explanation": "Replaced Tableau CASE using datepart('weekday', TODAY()) with DAX WEEKDAY(TODAY(), 1) and mapped CASE to SWITCH. Subtracted days from TODAY() as in the original. Created as a calculated column because this is a row-level date calculation without aggregations or parameters."
