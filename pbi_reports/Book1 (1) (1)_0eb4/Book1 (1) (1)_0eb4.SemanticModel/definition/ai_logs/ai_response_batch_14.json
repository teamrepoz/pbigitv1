      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau expression [Initial Cash USD T (excl Int/FWD) Abs] / TOTAL([Initial Cash USD T (excl Int/FWD) Abs]) to DAX. The numerator references the calculated field on the same table. The TOTAL(...) table calculation is represented by CALCULATE(..., ALL(table)) to get the overall total; DIVIDE is used to handle division safely.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The Tableau formula uses the table calculation TOTAL(...) (an aggregation across the table) and references an aggregated calculated field, therefore it must be implemented as a measure."
