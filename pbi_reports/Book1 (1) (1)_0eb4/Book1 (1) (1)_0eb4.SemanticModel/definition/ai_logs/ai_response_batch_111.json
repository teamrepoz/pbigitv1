      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau CASE statement to a DAX SWITCH on the row-level field 'migration_Extract_POC (1) (local copy)'[R/RR], mapping each WHEN to its corresponding result and preserving the multiplication by -1 for \"SFB\". This is implemented as a calculated column because the logic operates at the row level without aggregates or parameter references."
