      "solution_explanation": "Converted ABS and SUM directly to DAX ABS and SUM. Tableau TOTAL (table calculation) is translated to a full-table context using CALCULATE(..., ALL(table)) to compute the overall total. Wrapped numerator and denominator in VARs and used DIVIDE for safe division. The column reference was rewritten to 'migration_Extract_POC (1) (local copy)'[Initial Cash USD T (excl Int/FWD)]."
