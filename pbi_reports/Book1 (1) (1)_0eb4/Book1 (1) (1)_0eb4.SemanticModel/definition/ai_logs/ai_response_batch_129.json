      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau boolean OR expression to DAX. DATE([Last day of the month]) was translated to DATEVALUE(...) to compare the DateTime-calculated field to 'RpDate'. Logical ORs were mapped to || and the boolean result is returned via IF(TRUE/FALSE). All column references were converted to 'Table'[Column] format.",
      "type_changed_reason": "One or more dependent calculated fields referenced Tableau [Parameters] (via title date / Comparison date), and per rules any expression that uses parameters must be implemented as a measure."
