      "solution_explanation": "Converted the Tableau FIXED LOD that returns the minimum of two calculated fields into a DAX measure. The two referenced calculated fields are accessed directly using the table-qualified references; VARs capture each value and an IF expression returns the smaller of the two.",
      "type_changed_reason": "The Tableau expression uses a FIXED LOD ({FIXED ...}) which is an aggregation/context-level calculation; per rules it must be implemented as a measure in Power BI."
