      "solution_explanation": "Converted Tableau aggregations to DAX by qualifying columns with the table name. SUM([Total Expenses]) -> SUM('CoffeeChain Query (Sample - Cof (CoffeeChain DATASET)'[Total Expenses]) and SUM([Sales]) -> SUM('CoffeeChain Query (Sample - Cof (CoffeeChain DATASET)'[Sales]). Preserved the original arithmetic and multiplication by 100. Created as a measure because the formula contains aggregations.",
      "type_changed_reason": "This calculation uses aggregation (SUM), so it should be created as a measure."
