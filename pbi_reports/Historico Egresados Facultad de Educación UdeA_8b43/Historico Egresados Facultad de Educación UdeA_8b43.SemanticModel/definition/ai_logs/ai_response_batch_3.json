In Power BI this is typically implemented as a measure using RANKX over an ordering expression or a unique row identifier, for example: RANKX(ALLSELECTED('historicoEducacionCLEAN (historicoEducacionCLEAN)'), [OrderExpression], , ASC, DENSE). Because the original Tableau calculation provides no partition or ordering column, a direct conversion cannot be produced here; the measure returns BLANK() until an ordering/unique key is specified.",
